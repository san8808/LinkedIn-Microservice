## Overview 🚀

This project implements a microservices architecture to provide key LinkedIn functionalities. It's designed for scalability, resilience, and independent deployment of features like user profiles, posts, connections, and notifications.

> Briefly describe the specific set of LinkedIn functionalities this microservice encompasses. For example, is it solely focused on user profiles, or does it handle posts and connections as well?

## Key Features ✨

*   **Modular Architecture:** Microservices-based design for independent scaling and deployment.
*   **Event-Driven Communication:** Asynchronous communication between services using Apache Kafka.
*   **REST APIs:** Secure and well-documented RESTful APIs for each microservice.
*   **Cloud-Native:** Designed for deployment on cloud platforms like Google Cloud or AWS using Kubernetes.
*   **External Media Storage:** Integration with Cloudinary for storing and serving media files.

## Architecture 🏛️

The system adopts a microservices architecture, with each service responsible for a specific domain.  Services communicate asynchronously via Kafka for event-driven tasks and synchronously using Feign clients for direct API calls.

## Technologies Used 💻

*   **Backend:** Java 17+, Spring Boot
*   **Messaging:** Apache Kafka
*   **Database:** PostgreSQL (or other RDBMS)
*   **API Clients:** OpenFeign
*   **Containerization:** Docker
*   **Orchestration:** Kubernetes
*   **Media Storage:** Cloudinary
*   **Build Tool:** Maven

## Getting Started 🚀

Follow these steps to set up the project locally for development and testing.

### Prerequisites

*   Java 17+
*   Maven
*   Docker
*   Local Kafka setup (or access to a remote cluster)
*   PostgreSQL (or a local instance via Docker)

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ### Local Development

1.  Start Kafka and PostgreSQL:  Use Docker Compose (if a `docker-compose.yml` is provided) or start them manually.

2.  Configure environment variables: Create a `.env` file or set environment variables for database connections, Kafka brokers, Cloudinary credentials, etc.  See `.env.example` for the required variables.

    > Provide a `.env.example` file in the repository with placeholder values for all required environment variables.  This helps users understand which variables need to be configured.

bash
    mvn spring-boot:run
    2.  Push images to your container registry (e.g., Docker Hub, Google Container Registry):

    bash
    kubectl apply -f k8s/
    > Provide practical usage examples that demonstrate how to interact with the microservice's API endpoints. Include `curl` examples and explain the expected request/response formats.
> Focus on examples that are technology agnostic like curl requests.

**Example: Fetch User Profile**

1.  Fork the repository.
2.  Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`
3.  Write tests.
4.  Ensure your code adheres to the project's coding standards.
5.  Submit a pull request.
