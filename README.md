Project Overview
This is a modular microservices project designed to create a robust and scalable backend for social networking functionalities inspired by LinkedIn. By breaking down the application into small, autonomous services, it enables independent development, deployment, and scaling of features like posts, likes, connections, and notifications, ensuring a resilient and maintainable system.

Key Features
Modular Architecture üß±: The project is built with a microservices-first approach, deconstructing a monolithic application into small, independent services for better maintainability and scalability.

Event-Driven Communication üì¢: Utilizes Apache Kafka to ensure real-time updates and seamless, asynchronous communication between services.

Secure REST APIs üîí: Implements robust security, validation, and standardized error handling across all services.

Cloud-Native Deployment ‚òÅÔ∏è: Includes Kubernetes configurations for scalable, containerized operation, ensuring high availability and resilience on cloud platforms.

Media Integration üñºÔ∏è: Supports external file uploads and storage with Cloudinary, enabling rich, media-based content like profile pictures and post images.

Inter-Service Connectivity üîó: Uses Feign clients to simplify and streamline synchronous communication between different microservices.

Architectural Design
The system is built on a microservices architecture, where each service is responsible for a specific domain (e.g., User Service, Post Service, Notification Service). This design pattern allows for independent scaling, development, and deployment of each component. Kafka serves as the central message bus for asynchronous, event-driven communication, while Feign clients handle direct, synchronous API calls between services.

The entire system is containerized using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes for resilient, scalable deployment on Google Cloud.

Note: An architectural diagram showing the interconnected services will be added here.

Technologies Used
Backend: Java, Spring Boot

Messaging: Apache Kafka

Cloud: Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

Containerization: Docker, Kubernetes

Media Storage: Cloudinary

Database: PostgreSQL (or other RDBMS)

API Clients: OpenFeign

Build Tool: Maven

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

Prerequisites
This project requires the following dependencies to be installed:

Programming Language: Java 17+

Package Manager: Maven

Containerization: Docker

Messaging: Local Kafka setup (or access to a remote cluster)

Database: PostgreSQL (or a local instance via Docker)

Installation
Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/san8808/LinkedIn-Microservice](https://github.com/san8808/LinkedIn-Microservice)

Navigate to the project directory:

cd LinkedIn-Microservice

Install the dependencies:

The Maven pom.xml file handles all required dependencies. Simply run the following command to download and install them:

mvn clean install

Local Development
Start required services: Ensure your local Kafka and PostgreSQL instances are running. You can use Docker Compose to start these services easily if a docker-compose.yml file is provided in the repository.

Configure environment variables: Create an .env file or set environment variables for database connections, Kafka brokers, and Cloudinary credentials. Refer to the .env.example file for the required variables.

Run the application: Use your IDE or the Maven command to run each microservice individually.

mvn spring-boot:run

Deployment
The project includes Kubernetes manifests for deployment to a cloud environment like Google Cloud.

Build Docker images for each microservice:

docker build -t your-username/service-name .

Push images to your container registry:

docker push your-username/service-name

Apply Kubernetes manifests:

kubectl apply -f k8s/
